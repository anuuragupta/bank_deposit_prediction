<n><strong>This given task involves predicting whether a person will make a bank deposit or not. Various machine learning models have been evaluated based on their performance metrics, including Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, KNN, SVC, and NaiveByes. The models were assessed based on their ROC score, precision score, recall score, accuracy score, and Kappa score. Among these models, SVC and AdaBoost performed the best, achieving high accuracy and ROC scores. The other models, including Logistic Regression and KNN, also performed reasonably well. NaiveByes, on the other hand, performed the worst, with the lowest accuracy score.</strong></n>
